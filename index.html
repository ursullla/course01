            <p class=p1>
            The hyperloop first hit headlines with a 2012 tease from Elon Musk and a 2013 paper by engineers at SpaceX and Tesla. Skepticism was, perhaps, warranted. Accelerating pods 700+ miles an hour through a low-pressure tube sounds amazing, but there’s a fair distance between feasibility and a finished product.</p>
            <p>Since then, however, a number of companies and groups have taken up the cause, and at Singularity University’s Global Summit in San Francisco, we got a progress update from one of them.</p>

        <div id="id1">Elon Musk publishes the Hyperloop Alpha white paper which incites overwhelming industry excitement. Shervin presents it to President Obama, whose science advisors say it’s feasible. Obama says, "Let me know how I can help you."</div>
